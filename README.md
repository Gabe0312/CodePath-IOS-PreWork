## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Youtube:
  -The ability to have videos playing why the app is not open. 
  -The icons of the videos
Doordash:
  - The layout of the home page with the different resturaunt options.
  - The icons at the top of the page
Chipotle
  - The barren layout of the app goes in hand with the minimalistic feeling that you get when you get into the resturaunt.
  - The menu options and selections of the food are very thorough.

## Notes
I think that the Steam App should include highlights of your game achievements also it should have a more streamlined appearenece. Theres a Smart Home App that I wish to develop
that branches off an idea I was working on for a Hackathon.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Learning the layout of XCode and how to attach functionality of the button to the assistant in XCode.
